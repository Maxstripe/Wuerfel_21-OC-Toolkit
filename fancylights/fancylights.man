(Sorry for the hasty manpage)
This program allows you to have nice color changing lights.
It will run in the background(but produce tons of lag),
so you can do some other stuff alsor stuff at the same time!

There are some flags that affect behaviour:

-c - turns off all lights and stopps a running instance of FancyLights

-r - lets the lamps fade in and out based on the top input of the primary
redstoone component. I usually hook it up to a daylight sensor.
