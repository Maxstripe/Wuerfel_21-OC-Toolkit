  10 instrument  materials(2 of each kind):
    Wool for piano
    Glowstone for click

    Wood for Bass
    Soulsand for snare
      Note these are only recommended materials, others may work as well
2. place down the materials left and right from you, like this:

  1   1
  2   2
  3 P 3
  4   4
  5   5

  then place a noteblock above each and place a adapter next to each(noteblock)
  Check if there is a block above any noteblock, and if yes remove it.
  Now connect the Adapters to your computer.
3.Now craft, buy or steal a Analyzer. Now run "noteconf" on your computer,
  and it should ask for adresses of specific note blocks. Read them out
  using the Analyzer and enter the first 3 characters of the adress.
